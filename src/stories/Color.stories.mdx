## Radix Colors

I am using the [Radix Color System](https://radixcolor.com/) and really enjoying it.

### Tailwind Plugin

Under the hood, this is implemented with the [radix-colors-for-tailwind](https://github.com/samrobbins85/radix-colors-for-tailwind) plugin.

#### Provided Classes

- `color-bg`
  - If you do `color-bg` e.g. `blue-bg`, you will get a background color of step 3, this follows the pattern explained here. If you want to make this interactive, instead use the class `color-bg-int`, and you will also have states for hover and focus.
- `color-cta`
  - Following a similar pattern, `color-cta` will give you a background color of step 4 for a darker look, and similarly gives you the option of `color-cta-int` to have hover and focus states
- `color-border`
  - If you want to add borders to your components, you can use the `color-border` pattern, this uses step 6 by default, but will use step 7 if you do `color-border-int`
- `color-solid`
  - If you want solid backgrounds to your components rather than the lighter ones provided by the other classes, then you can use `color-solid`, giving you a background of step 9, again, there's a `color-solid-int` option that also gives you a hover state at step 10

### Color Scale

The documentation for the steps is [here.](https://www.radix-ui.com/docs/colors/palette-composition/understanding-the-scale#use-cases)

- Steps 1-2: Backgrounds
  - Step 1 is for the main background
  - Step 2 is for subtle component backgrounds like cards and code blocks
- Steps 3-5: Component backgrounds
  - Step 3 is for normal states.
  - Step 4 is for hover states.
  - Step 5 is for pressed or selected states.
- Steps 6-8: Border colors
  - Step 6 is designed for subtle borders on components which are not interactive. For example sidebars, headers, cards, alerts, and separators.
  - Step 7 is designed for borders on interactive components, but can also be used for focus rings.
  - Step 8 is designed for borders on interactive components in their hover state.
- Steps 9-10: Solid backgrounds
  - Step 9 has the highest chroma of all steps in the scale
    - Can be used for site, section, header, component backgrounds as well as graphics, overlays, shadows, and accent borders.
  - Step 10 is designed for component hover states, where step 9 is the component's normal state background.
