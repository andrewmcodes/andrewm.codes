I have Combined Type ADHD and **it's a big part of what makes meâ€¦me.** It isn't my [entire personality](/personality/), but it is constantly affecting me to the point I feel **it's important to know about when you meet or interact with me.**

I didn't know I had it until late in college and I often think about how different my life would have been had I known, and gotten help for it, earlier.

Because of this and because it is such a big part of my life, **I talk very openly about my ADHD** on [social media](/about/), on [podcasts](/podcasts/), and to hiring managers.

Since I became very vocal about it, I have met so many other ADHD developers, some of whom were afraid to admit they had it previously because of the stigma. Even more importantly, **several folks have told me they realized they had ADHD** after hearing me talk about the symptoms and have gotten help.

There are companies out there who wouldn't consider hiring me because of my ADHD, but every time I hear from someone who benefitted from me discussing it openly, **I don't care.**

Medication completely changed my life and I currently take Vyvanse to help manage my ADHD.
