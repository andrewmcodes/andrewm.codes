I have tried different methods to keep development projects on my computer organized but between work projects, open source, side projects, issue reproductions, demos, and little test projects, it gets tough. I did a quick peruse through my computer and counted over 100 repos (some on GitHub, some not). They are all over the place, and I have only had this computer for 3 months! 😱
