My [Twitter avatar](https://twitter.com/andrewmcodes) is outlined by a blue, previously green, progress bar that I get asked about often.

The progress bar is updated in real-time every time I get a new follower. When I reach 10 new followers, the progress bar resets and the loop begins again.

To achieve this effect, I use [BlackMagic.so](https://blackmagic.so/), a suite of tools for influencers to enhance [Twitter](https://twitter.com/andrewmcodes) from [Tony Dinh.](https://twitter.com/tdinh_me) Their main product is an analytics tools, but they have a free tool named [Profile Progress Bar](https://blackmagic.so/profile-progress-bar), which you can use to add a progress bar to your Twitter avatar.

<% end %>

Connect your [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/andrewmcodes) to BlackMagic.so to add a progress bar to your Twitter avatar. You can customize the colors and progress value to your liking and start the real-time updates.

BlackMagic.so has several other free, and paid tools, but this is currently the only one I use.

There is no real reason other than it's fun.
