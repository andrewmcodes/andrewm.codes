I find it very hard to describe my personality.

INTP. I think the description below is pretty spot-on.

> INTPs are philosophical innovators, fascinated by logical analysis, systems, and design. They are preoccupied with theory, and search for the universal law behind everything they see. They want to understand the unifying themes of life, in all their complexity.

> INTPs are detached, analytical observers who can seem oblivious to the world around them because they are so deeply absorbed in thought. They spend much of their time in their own heads: exploring concepts, making connections, and seeking understanding of how things work. To the Architect, life is an ongoing inquiry into the mysteries of the universe. 1

To really understand me, you have to understand that I have [Combined Type ADHD](#), which means I struggle a lot with my hyperactivity and attention span.

[View this post](/adhd/) for more details and why I talk openly about it.

Recently I have increasingly more aware of my inate perfectionism and how it negatively affects me.
