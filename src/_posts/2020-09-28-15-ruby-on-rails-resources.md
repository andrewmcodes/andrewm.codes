I wanted to get a lot of writing done this weekend but unfortunately I had to take care of a cranky app instead.

It's been awhile since I have posted though, and since I know how my brain works, there was some inner worry that I'd keep slipping out of my (once regular) habit of writing.

For my own mental health, I promised myself I would post something, but I needed to do it quickly. After digging through my browser history for something, it dawned on me that there was a lot of great content in there that some of y'all may find interesting as well!

Without further adieu, here are 5 blog posts, 5 projects, and 5 podcasts that I read/listened to this weekend:
