## My sponsors

I am **filled with gratitude to every sponsor**, regardless of the amount or duration. It feels like a pat on the back and a **clear signal that I am doing something good.**

Thank you to everyone on this list for sponsoring me!

### Current sponsors

- [Jared White](https://jaredwhite.com): my longest sponsor ‚ù§Ô∏è
- [ScoutAPM](https://scoutapm.com/): my largest sponsor üôè

### Previous sponsors

- [Daniel Westendorf](https://github.com/danielwestendorf)
- [Curtis Mckee](https://github.com/curtismckee)

## Where that money goes

**All the money I make from sponsorships on GitHub goes back into the community**, whether it's me sponsoring other projects with it, paying for people to go to conferences, and anything in between that helps the community.

## Who I Sponsor

I have recently started to try and spread my sponsor budget to more projects vs. staying committed to a single creator just to show everyone some love.

### Currently Sponsoring

I could use automations to ensure this is always accurate but that is for another day. [View list on GitHub ->](https://github.com/andrewmcodes?tab=sponsoring)

- [Haml](https://github.com/sponsors/haml) because I ‚ù§Ô∏è Haml and their project plan for improvements the language really excite me
- [Jared White](https://github.com/sponsors/jaredcwhite) for his work on Bridgetown, the content he creates, and the time he has given me in the past
- [wingrunr21](https://github.com/sponsors/wingrunr21) to support development for the VS Code Ruby plugin

### Formerly Sponsoring

If they are in this list, then I would sponsor them again & want the community to support them if they can (that's you! üòâ)

- [Piotr Murach](https://github.com/sponsors/piotrmurach) for his content on creating gems and the TTY gem libraries that I love!
- [Samuel Williams](https://github.com/sponsors/ioquatix) for his work on Falcon and Async
- [Thorbj√∏rn Lindeijer](https://github.com/sponsors/bjorn) to support development of Tiled
- [Matestack](https://github.com/sponsors/matestack) to support the development of more component libraries for Rails
- [Collin Jilbert](https://github.com/sponsors/cjilbert504) for his help on my open source projects
