A custom theme for [Warp](https://www.warp.dev) based on [One Dark Darker.](https://github.com/Binaryify/OneDark-Pro#darker-theme)

## Install

Create Warp theme config directory in your home directory if you don't have one already:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.warp/themes/
```

Add the theme config to this directory:

```sh
curl -O --output-dir ~/.warp/themes https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andrewmcodes/warp-one-dark-darker/main/One_Dark_Darker.yaml
```

Open the Warp theme picker and select `One Dark Darker`

If you do not see `One Dark Darker` when selecting your theme in Warp, **restart the application.**

According to the docs:

> ...it may take several minutes for Warp to initially discover the new config directory. You can either wait, or just restart the application.
