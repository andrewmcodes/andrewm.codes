## Typography

I am using [IBM Plex Sans](https://www.ibm.com/plex/) on this site, a nice variable font. For markdown pages, I am using [the Tailwind CSS typography plugin](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-typography) with a few modifications.

## Technologies

[Bridgetown](https://bridgetownrb.com) does most of the heavy lifting on this site - it's a Ruby based static site generator that I have fallen in love with.

I am using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and [ViewComponent](https://viewcomponent.org) to build and design the UI. All posts are written in [Kramdown flavored markdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org) with ViewComponent's sprinkled in. I store all of the images in [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/invites/lpov9zyyucivvxsnalc5/ztosjslptijb8cyexrrt?t=default) and get my icons from [Nucleo](https://nucleoapp.com/?ref=11689).

Under the hood, [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io) is handling asset bundling. I use almost no JavaScript on this site, but I have sprinkled [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev) here and there for small interactions.

## Deployment

This site is [open source on GitHub](https://github.com/andrewmcodes/andrewm-codes-site) and that is how I deploy. The site is hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and all pushes to the main branch trigger a deploy. I also use [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com) for DNS and domain management.

## Tracking

I am using [Plausible Analytics](https://plausible.io/), which is a GDPR, CCPA and cookie law compliant site analytics tool. I chose a privacy focused tool because I just want to know what pages are popular, not get a breakdown of the users. This is a personal site afterall.

For the curious: you can find my public analytics dashboard on the [analytics page.](/analytics/)

## Third-party Service Providers

The only third-party service provider that will process and store any entered data is the newsletter form, which is backed by [Revue](https://www.getrevue.co). Read their [terms of service](https://www.getrevue.co/terms) and [privacy policy.](https://www.getrevue.co/privacy)

## How to make a request about your data

You can contact me to ask me what data I hold about you, which is probably an email address and name at most, who has access to it and how it is being used. I will delete any data about you that I hold if you ask me to.
