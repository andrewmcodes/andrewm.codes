Hey, I'm [Andrew!](https://twitter.com/andrewmcodes) I am a full stack software engineer specializing in Ruby on Rails development, currently as a Senior Product Developer at [Podia](https://www.podia.com). I am a [content creator](/subscribe/) and [podcaster](/podcasts/) in the Ruby community, best known as a [co-host on the Remote Ruby podcast](https://remoteruby.com) and early collaborator on [Stimulus Reflex.](https://github.com/stimulusreflex/stimulus_reflex)

## Background

Growing up in North Carolina, I always had a strong interest in the field of computing due to chronic boredom and the unlimited possibilities the internet had to offer. In middle school, I began attending an after-school technology training program where I got my first experience with basic web development and learned how to fix and refurbish computers. All the computers we built went to families in need in the community. From this point forward, I would begin actively moving towards a job in tech.

In high school, I got deep into the world of Wordpress and learning ways to make money online, along with an increasing interesting in hacking and IT security. This is where I would take my first official programming course, Visual Basic, followed up by a year of Java.

I attended the University of North Carolina at Wilmington where I received a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science. Since graduating, I have had several years of professional experience in the software engineering and web development industry.

## Personality

I think of myself as very authentic and consumed with deep curiosity and excitement. [I also have ADHD](/adhd/), which may explain the constant excitement and curiosity combo coupled with massive procrastination in the "boring" areas of my life. Itâ€™s not my whole personality but, ADHD has a massive impact on my daily life, which is why I talk about it whenever I can to whomever will listen. I also struggle a lot with perfectionism in my daily life.

I love going to conferences, but [as a huge introvert](/my-personality/), they take a lot out of me. I am a homebody but love a good adventure, which is why you will often find me hiking or attending a sporting event on the weekends here in Phoenix.

## Support

Want to support my work in the Ruby community or on [open source projects?](/projects/) All I ask is that you consume the content that I create, whether [written](/posts/), [podcasts](/podcasts/), etc. and let me know how I can improve!

You can also [sponsor me on GitHub!](https://github.com/sponsors/andrewmcodes) I usually take the sponsorships I receive and put them right back into sponsoring other creators and maintainers.
