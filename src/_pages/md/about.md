Hey, I'm Andrew. I am a full stack Ruby on Rails software engineer, podcaster, and creator currently working remotely from Phoenix, Arizona.

I've been on [lots of podcasts over the years](/podcasts/), and am currently the co-host of [Remote Ruby](https://remoteruby.com).

I grew up in North Carolina and graduated with a degree in Computer Science. I spend my free time playing video games, hiking around Arizona, and playing with [my setup](/uses/).

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/andrewmcodes), where I share resources I've found, talk about Ruby, and post memes. [GitHub](https://github.com/andrewmcodes) is where I'm building in the open and contributing to open source.

## Personality

**INTP**. I think the description below is pretty spot-on.

> INTPs are philosophical innovators, fascinated by logical analysis, systems, and design. They are preoccupied with theory, and search for the universal law behind everything they see. They want to understand the unifying themes of life, in all their complexity.

> INTPs are detached, analytical observers who can seem oblivious to the world around them because they are so deeply absorbed in thought. They spend much of their time in their own heads: exploring concepts, making connections, and seeking understanding of how things work. To the Architect, life is an ongoing inquiry into the mysteries of the universe. [^1]

## ADHD

I have ADHD and it's a big part of what makes me...me. Interestingly, I often have people reach out to bond over this fact, which has encouraged me to talk openly about it. Feel free to contact me if you're also an ADHD developer and want to chat about it.
