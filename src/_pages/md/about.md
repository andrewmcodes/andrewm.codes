Hey, I'm Andrew. I am developer, podcaster, and creator in the Ruby community. I work at The N2 Company building Ruby on Rails applications as a software developer.

I've been on [lots of podcasts over the years](/podcasts/), and am currently the co-host of [Remote Ruby](https://remoteruby.com).

I have ADHD and it's a big part of what makes me...me. Interestingly, I often have people reach out to bond over this fact, which has encouraged me to talk openly about it. Feel free to contact me if you're also an ADHD developer and want to chat about it.

I grew up in North Carolina and graduated with a degree in Computer Science. I spend my free time playing video games, hiking around Arizona, and playing with [my setup](/uses/).

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/andrewmcodes), where I share resources I've found, talk about Ruby, and post memes. [GitHub](https://github.com/andrewmcodes) is where I'm building in the open and contributing to open source.
