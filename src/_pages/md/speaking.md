## Conferences

I have not spoken at any conferences (yet). If you would like to have me speak at your event, [please contact me.](/about#contact)

## CFPs

All of the CFPs that I have submitted for prior conferences live on this site in the hopes they may help me or someone else out one day.

## Podcasts

The majority of my public speaking comes in the form of podcasts.
