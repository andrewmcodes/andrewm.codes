## Data gathered & cookies tracked

- There should not be any cookies getting tracked - and please let me know if you see otherwise.
- As far as data gathered, I am using [Plausible Analytics](https://plausible.io/), which is a GDPR, CCPA and cookie law compliant site analytics tool. I don't care who you are, I am curious how you are using the site, so that is why I chose a privacy focused tool and for that reason, I have [made my analytics dashboard public](https://plausible.io/andrewm.codes) so that you can see exactly what is being gathered.

Read [Plausible's data policy](https://plausible.io/data-policy) to learn exactly what is being gathered, but know that it is not anything personally identifiable nor your IP address.
