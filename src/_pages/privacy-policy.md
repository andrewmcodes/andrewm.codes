## Data gathered & cookies tracked

- There should not be any cookies getting tracked - and please let me know if you see otherwise.
- As far as data gathered, I am using [Plausible Analytics](https://plausible.io/), which is a GDPR, CCPA and cookie law compliant site analytics tool. I don't care who you are, I just am curious how you are using the site, so that is why I chose a privacy focused tool and for that reason, I have [made my analytics dashboard public](https://plausible.io/andrewm.codes) so that you can see exactly what is being gathered.

Read [Plausible's data policy](https://plausible.io/data-policy) to learn exactly what is being gathered, but know that it is not anything personally identifiable nor your IP address.

We are collecting this data solely to allow me to follow up with you via email whether that is directly if you use the contact form or indirectly via my newsletter. We will not share your personal information with or sell it to third-party marketers.

I treat your data the way I would want you to treat mine. As soon as it is unneeded for contacting your or adding you to the newsletter it is deleted, and left in the hands of third party services.

Just to be clear, this data would either be in the form of a submitted contact form, which I delete after reading, or in the form of your email address in ConvertKit, which I will happily remove - no questions asked.
