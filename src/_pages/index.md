This website is my home on the web and part of my digital brain. This is where I [publish tutorials, tips, and more](/posts/) about Ruby, Ruby on Rails, developer tooling, and more. It is constantly evolving as I explore new ideas so don't be surprised to find a few unfinished features lying around.
